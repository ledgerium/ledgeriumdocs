Proof of Stake - PoS

Quorum - private/public hybrid blockchain
---------------------------------------

   - Privacy & Transparency
   - Performance & throughput
   - Permissioned & Governance
   Quorum supports both transaction-level privacy and network-wide transparency, customizable to business requirements.

Why Quorum
-------------

   - Digital trust
   - Signature validation in a permissioned network
   - Ethereum like community and license model
   - Quorum is designed to develop and evolve alongside Ethereum

ZKP
-------------

   A zero-knowledge proof or protocol allows a “prover” to assure a “verifier” that they have knowledge of a secret or statement without revealing the secret itself. Quorum & Ethereum

IBFT
-------------

   IBFT is plug-in and play consensus mechanism on Quorum as Byzantine Fault Tolerance BFT. BFT conceptually means, it can tolerate F fault nodes in the total no of N nodes = 3F+1. AMIs guys!!!

Why IBFT
-------------

   IBFT provides immediate finality to the blocks. It has its internal proposal and voting mechanism before any blocks get written on the blockchain!

Scalability
   -------------

   Originally it is 15 transactions per second in PoW. However, with the given consensus mechanism of IBFT, with 1 block per second, higher blockagas limit, we can achieve 200 transactions per second. Anything beyond, we will wait for Ethereum core platform. In mid-2019, they are going to release Beacon Chain which has sharding feature implemented for scalability
