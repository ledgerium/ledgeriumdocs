Using ``ledgerium account new``
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you have the ledgerium client installed, creating an account is merely a case of executing the ``ledgerium account new`` command in a terminal.

Note that you do not have to run the ledgerium client or sync up with the blockchain to use the ``ledgerium account`` command.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ledgerium account new

    Your new account is locked with a password. Please give a password. Do not forget this password.
    Passphrase:
    Repeat Passphrase:
    Address: {168bc315a2ee09042d83d7c5811b533620531f67}

For non-interactive use you supply a plaintext password file as argument to the ``--password`` flag. The data in the file consists of the raw bytes of the password optionally followed by a single newline.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ledgerium --password /path/to/password account new

..  Warning:: The ``--password`` flag is meant to be used only for testing or automation in trusted environments. It is a bad idea to save your password to file or expose it in any other way. If you do use the ``--password`` flag with a password file, make sure the file is not readable or even listable for anyone but you. You can achieve this in Mac/Linux systems with:

.. code-block:: bash

  touch /path/to/password
  chmod 600 /path/to/password
  cat > /path/to/password
  >I type my pass


To list all the accounts with keyfiles currently in your ``keystore`` folder use the ``list`` subcommand of the ``ledgerium account`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ledgerium account list

  account #0: {a94f5374fce5edbc8e2a8697c15331677e6ebf0b}
  account #1: {c385233b188811c9f355d4caec14df86d6248235}
  account #2: {7f444580bfef4b9bc7e14eb7fb2a029336b07c9d}


The filenames of keyfiles has the format ``UTC--<created_at UTC ISO8601>-<address hex>``. The order of accounts when listing, is lexicographic, but as a consequence of the timestamp format, it is actually order of creation.
