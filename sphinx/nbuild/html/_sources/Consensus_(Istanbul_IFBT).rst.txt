Consensus (Istanbul IFBT)
==========================================

With no need for POW/POS in a permissioned network, Quorum instead offers multiple consensus mechanisms that are more appropriate for consortium chains:

Raft-based Consensus: A consensus model for faster blocktimes, transaction finality, and on-demand block creation. See Raft-based consensus for Ledgerium/Quorum for more information
Istanbul BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) Consensus: A PBFT-inspired consensus algorithm with transaction finality, by AMIS. See Istanbul BFT Consensus documentation, the RPC API, and this technical web article for more information
Clique POA Consensus: a default POA consensus algorithm bundled with Go Ledgerium. See Clique POA Consensus Documentation and a guide to setup clique json with puppeth
