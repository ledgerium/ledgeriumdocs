RPC
================================================================================

In previous sections we have seen how contracts can be written, deployed and interacted with. Now it's time to dive into the details of communicating
with the Ledgerium network and smart contracts.

An Ledgerium node offers a `RPC <https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call>`_ interface. This interface gives √êapp's access to the Ledgerium
blockchain and functionality that the node provides, such as compiling smart contract code. It uses a subset of the
`JSON-RPC 2.0 <http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification>`_ specification (no support for notifications or named parameters) as the serialisation protocol and
is available over HTTP and IPC (unix domain sockets on linux/OSX and named pipe's on Windows).
