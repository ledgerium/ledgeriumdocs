Governance UI

What is it?
-----------

Governance UI is a way for validators to participate in on-chain governance

Role of Validators
-------------------
A Validator is an independent individual who stakes their XLG and is entrusted to maintain a node on the network that validates transactions and commits new blocks to the blockchain. Validators receive a reward in XLG for provisioning blocks.

Responsibilites for Validators
-------------------------------
A Validator has both technical and social responsiblities both of which are important for the health, performance and security of the network.

Technical Responsibilites

* Ensure node is secure by practicing safe key management
* Maintain node requisite software version
* Monitor node to ensure its availablility and participation in consensus
* Monitor network in general and communicate with other Validators, network entities if problems arise.

Social Responsibilites

* Participate in on-chain Governace of the network

Governance is a collection of DApps where ballots are proposed and voted on by existing Validators to manage the network. The Ballot types include:

* Adding new Validators
* Removing Validators, i.e. for compromising security of network, malicious behavior, non-participation in Governance

Prerequisites
-------------

To participate in Governance, you must:

* Be voted in as a Validator
* Have the Ledgerium Wallet installed
* Import your private key to the wallet


What constitutes a passing vote
-------------------------------

A vote is passed if the sum is greater than to n/2, where n is the number of existing validator nodes


Getting started with Governance UI
-----------------------------------

Navigate to `http://testnet.ledgerium.net:3545/`


* Current admins/validator list; if you are a Validator your node will be on this list
