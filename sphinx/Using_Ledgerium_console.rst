Using Ledgerium console
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to create a new account using ledgerium, we must first start ledgerium in console mode (or you can use ``ledgerium attach`` to attach a console to an already running instance):

.. code-block:: bash

  > ledgerium console 2>> file_to_log_output
  instance: ledgerium/v1.4.0-unstable/linux/go1.5.1
  coinbase: coinbase: [object Object]
  at block: 865174 (Mon, 18 Jan 2016 02:58:53 GMT)
  datadir: /home/USERNAME/.ledgerium

The console allows you to interact with your local node by issuing commands. For example, try the command to list your accounts:

.. code-block:: javascript

  > eth.accounts

  {
  code: -32000,
  message: "no keys in store"
  }

This shows that you have no accounts. You can also create an account from the console:

.. code-block:: javascript

  > personal.newAccount()
  Passphrase:
  Repeat passphrase:
  "0xb2f69ddf70297958e582a0cc98bce43294f1007d"

.. Note:: Remember to use a strong and randomly generated password.

We just created our first account. If we try to list our accounts again we can see our new account:

.. code-block:: javascript

  > eth.accounts
  ["0xb2f69ddf70297958e582a0cc98bce43294f1007d"]
